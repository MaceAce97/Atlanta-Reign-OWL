# Atlanta-Reign-OWL
Data broken down for the Overwatch 2 League (OWL) team Atlanta Reigns, specifically their 2022 season. 
The data that I broke down was their overall win percentages, which includes their regular season plays and playoffs. The win percentages came from the number of maps
they played on over how many win they had in total. So for the player "Ultraviolet" they played on 129 maps, won 68 maps, so they had a win percentage of 52.7% (.527).
Another aspect that I showcased was their play differential, which is the difference between how many games they won to how many they lost. Most of the players had a 
positive differiental, which means they had more wins than loses over all, but there wre a couple that had a negative diff and had more losts than wins this season. So,
the player "Nero" had played on 53 maps, won on 21 maps, but lost on 32 maps, which concludes to a -11 diff, which can be season in the second bar graph under Nero. 

I used Numpy, matplotlib, and pandas in this project to set up the graphs and have the ability to use the correct modules to work with the data. 

The features I used in this project was the following: 
-Read in data from a local csv, excel file, json, or any other file type.
-Use built-in pandas or numpy functions to do things like remove 0's and null values where they dont belong in your dataset
-Use at least 5 different built-in Python functions to find out something about your data.
-Make 2 basic plots with matplotlib, seaborn, or any other kind of visualization library that you think looks interesting.
